/*
String: predefined class from java.lang package

Following method of object class are overrided here-
	toString(): Actually print object into String form but here it will print value stored inside the object
	
	equals(Object obj): Actually compared two object based on address but here compare based on object value
	
	== : Actually compare two value but here it compares two object based on address
